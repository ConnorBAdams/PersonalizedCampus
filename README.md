# TailoredTours
A project for CS 495 focused on giving personalized tours of locations. 

After pulling the repo the following steps can be used to run the React Native app:
1. Make sure to have Node/NPM installed (https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
2. Navigate to the repo in command line (Make sure your are in the subdirectory of the repo 'PersonalizedCampus\PersonalizedCampus')
3. Run 'npm install' to install the required node modules because there are a lot of them and we do not want to commit all of them
4. Run 'expo start' to start the Expo server

If there are any issues then it is likely related to the node modules not building properly.
